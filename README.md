## User Experience

## Design

This game was designed with a mobile first approach. The CSS was built to be compatible with smaller screen sizes first, and was scaled for larger screens where appropriate using media queries.

The game is designed to be as intuitive as possible, with clear distinction for interactive elements via color scheme & hover effects.

It is designed with each section of the game structured in its own div within the HTML, to allow for easier readability, scalability and de-bugging.
